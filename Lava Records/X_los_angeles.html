            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>By the time the late ’70s rolled around, maybe it was more punk to be in Los Angeles. In California, the artists revolted against the easy feelings that pervaded FM radio and ripped apart the culture of cocaine and groupies and limousines. Los Angeles is where X first marked their spot, the title of their 1980 debut, and the first of their catalog to be reissued this year as the band heads back to the studio to make a new record and on tour.
            Several songs off Los Angeles were featured in The Decline of Western Civilization, Penelope Spheeris’ 1981 documentary of the L.A. punk scene, placing X in the landscape of Germs, Black Flag, and the Circle Jerks. The band couldn’t have been more Los Angeles: The X of their name signifies anti-everything, certainly a lack of a proper signature in an autograph-worshipping town. Singer and bass player John Doe took his stage name from the police code for an anonymous person. He came to L.A. inspired by how the city was starkly rendered by writers like John Fante and Charles Bukowski. Exene Cervenka, née Christine, was living in Tallahassee; they met in a poetry workshop. Drummer DJ Bonebrake was in the early L.A. punk band the Eyes; guitarist Billy Zoom came up in groups that opened for Etta James and Johnnie Taylor and joined Gene Vincent’s rockab.</p><br>
            <p>What is any listener to do when an album re-enters the world decades later in which a dearth of compassion is met with a dangerous shortage of nuance and complexity? What are artists to do, if anything? The reissue doesn’t attempt to answer those questions. There’s no 2019 addendum in its liner notes. The lyric sheet is reprinted in full here, but does not rewrite or redact or explain.

                Granted, that leaves “Los Angeles” in its original context. It’s evident the narrator has hatred for “every...Jew” and “every Mexican that gave her a lotta shit/Every homosexual and the idle rich.” The fact that they reserve their lone actual slur to refer to, presumably, African-American persons loads it with greater violence. The character is based on a former roommate of Cervenka’s, known as Farrah Fawcett Minor, who was leaving L.A. for England. If she’s the narrator of a song, whose name is a city, perhaps—charitably—she is also a metaphor of the city’s rapidly evaporating past, the buried ugliness of intolerance. The song is a reminder, in a culture that rhapsodizes the early days of punk, exactly how limited its considerations of the most marginalized people were, how narrow its stage once was and how vast it is becoming.</p>
