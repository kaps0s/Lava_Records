            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Queen II is the second studio album by Queen. It was released on 8 March 1974 by EMI Records in the United Kingdom and by Elektra Records in the United States.As soon as sessions for Queen finished in March 1973, the band took a brief break before jumping back into the studios to work on their follow-up. The creatively fertile band, bursting with ideas, entered London's Trident Studios in August to lay down songs that would become their second album, unimaginatively titled Queen II. (Brian later admitted that the band considered calling it Over The Top, but this idea was discarded.) In addition to songs that had been written around the same time as those that appeared on the debut album (including Father To Son, Ogre Battle, and Seven Seas Of Rhye), as well as an older song written by Brian during his days in Smile (White Queen (As It Began)), songs were written that were far more adventurous than anything attempted before.Part of this creativity was due to the need to distinguish themselves from other bands of the time. Glam rock was an ever-emerging form of rock 'n' roll, and with David Bowie and Roxy Music releasing albums that would define the genre (Aladdin Sane and For Your Pleasure, respectively), suddenly this style was becoming popular. Mott the Hoople became the ultimate glam rock band of the 1970s (second only to T. Rex); interestingly, Queen would support Mott on their winter 1973 UK tour, and again on their spring 1974 US tour. And it shouldn't go unmentioned that the band had approached Mr. Bowie to produce Queen II, but the chameleon rocker had to decline; their only collaboration wouldn't come until eight years later.</p><br>
            <p>The album was rereleased by Hollywood Records in 1991, adding the non-album B-side single See What A Fool I've Been (based off a Sonny Terry & Brownie McGhee song, 'That's How I Feel', and written by Brian during his days in Smile) as well as two remixes: a fairly straightforward one of Ogre Battle, and an insipid dance remix of Seven Seas Of Rhye (yet it was baffingly met with high approval from Freddie).</p>
